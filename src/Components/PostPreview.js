        Me and my partner used to get 2 for £1 bakery products at Tesco. You
        could get mini flapjacks, rice krispie cakes, cornflake cakes...you know
        the one. <br></br>
        <br></br>It went upto £1.50 and eventually we stopped when it hit 2 for
        £2 because 2 for £2 seemed extorionate when we used to get 2 for half
        that price. The other day, we went into Tesco and fancied some as we
        hadn't had any in years. We went to the bakery section...£2...each. Its
        not like I can't afford them, but its the principle. Me and my partner
        used to get 2 for £1 bakery products at Tesco.
