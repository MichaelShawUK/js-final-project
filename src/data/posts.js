    text: `I just finished The Dark Tower series! It was a long journey, but for sure a remarkable one!

    Contrary to many other readers though, I really liked the last 3 books. Also loved the ending! Roland's quest was hard and sad, and it seems to focus on obsession and redemption, and it was amazing!
    
    It started a bit slow to me, and at some point I almost gave up. There are some mannerisms in King's writing style and some references to american pop culture that I didn't really like, and sometimes felt a bit cringe, but maybe it's because I'm not too familiar with said references.
    
    But I'm glad I decided to stick to it, because after a while I was hooked to the tale and the characters, and, by the end, it was like a sad and hard farewell! Not many stories touches me this way now that I'm getting old.
    
    The tale, the journey, the characters, they were amazing! His characters feel very human with the right amount of complexity. It made me connect to them and understand them, even if they're so different than me!
    
    If you ever had the interest to read the series but for some reason decided to hold back, I urge you to do it! If you're looking for a new series to read, give it a try! I think you will not regret!
    
    Never read any other Stephen King's books, but after reading The Dark Tower I am anxious to read many of his other books. Might read Pet Sematary or The Stand next!`,
